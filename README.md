- General Purpose LLMs 
	- Responds to all types of Queries (Including Function Calling)
	- Usually Larger and requires more compute resources to host
- Special Purpose LLMs
	- Purpose built and trained on small set of focused tasks
	- Smaller and lower latency than General Purpose LLMs

Diff types of Function Calling : 
	- Single Calls 
	- Parallel Calls
	- No Calls
	- Multiple Functions
	- Nested Functions

Example Applications: 
 - Interfacing with External APIs /documentation 
-  Address Extraction - Example (Structured Data Extraction)
-  Chat with your SQL Database 
-  Web search Agentic workflow  
- Extract structured data from natural language inputs, making real-world data usable for analysis.
- Build an end-to-end application that processes customer service transcripts using LLMs.
